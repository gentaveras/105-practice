            <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming, things might might make sense at first. You'll start
                  to get the hang of it and then when you least expect it your code will all go
                  to shambles and you'll go scrambling to see where you went wrong. And I'm here to
                  tell you that that is <strong> <em>completely</em></strong> OK!! When it comes to
                  your first web app, you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new
                  opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that
                  it's probably never been done before. <strong>Confusion is good. </strong> Confusion means you're
                  able to understand the concepts well enough to come up with your own conclusions
                  and realize they may conflict with what should be happening. This is good because
                  the information isn't going in one ear and out the other. It's sticking and you're
                  trying to make sense of it. <em>Embrace the confusion.</em> Write down everything that
                  doesn't make sense and <strong>WHY</strong> it doesn't make sense. Challenge every train of thought.
                  Every logical conundrum you're having. When you finally figure out what the problem
                  is -because as impossible as it seems, you <em>WILL</em> figure it out- you'll realize so many
                  things beyond your initial question fall into place and you have a greater general
                  understanding of coding. You'll be figuring things out before they have the chance
                  to stump you. Look at you getting ahead of the game!</p>

                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal
                  that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that
                  it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because <em><strong>clarity awaits.</strong></em></p>

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your
                  first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this
                  uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this
                  THING but you don't understand <em>HOW</em> exactly it's happening.</p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact,
                  it's a <strong>critical</strong> part of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process
                  includes learning to <em>train your eye.</em> The way to train your eye is to read a good deal
                  of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing. You may not know what it means
                at first glance, but soon enough the code won't look unfamiliar and intimidating and you'll feel
                comfortable trying to decipher what it's trying to say when the interface isn't as scary</p>
